Project for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with extra hardware

## Problem Statement

Nowadays, and in order to expand and keep up with the fast growth of other technological
entertainment areas such as video games or virtual and augmented reality, the music industry needs
to change and adapt its’ approach to the public, or else it will come to a downfall.

The main goal of this project is to create an user-friendly interface, easily accessible and in-
tuitive, that does not only spark the interest of young musical producers but can also satisfy the

needs of advanced music producers. By allowing these users to interact with the interface, the music
composition experience can become more fluid and dynamic.
To achieve something like this, an interface that produces sounds with a good workflow and a
friendly user interface is needed. In order to do so, the product must be capable of providing some
features, such as:
• adjustable time scale;
• simple visual interface and easy interaction;
• jack plug-in output.
The interface that will provide this will be of a board with several touch inputs that will play
one sound for each input button and have the capacity to save input sequences and apply some sound
effects to them.
